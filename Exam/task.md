Bicycle Rental & Tour Company
I run a bicycle rental shop in a tourist city with 80 bikes of various types-20 city bikes,
25 electric bikes, 15 mountain bikes, 10 tandem bikes, and 10 children's bikes. Each
bike type has different daily rental rates: city bikes at €12/day, electric at €28/day,
mountain at €18/day, tandems at €22/day, and children's bikes at €8/day. Rental periods
run in 4-hour blocks or full days (09:00-21:00).

We also offer guided tours at 10:00 and 15:00 daily. The city tour takes 3 hours and fits
12 participants, the coastal route takes 5 hours and fits 8 participants, and the
challenging mountain trail takes 6 hours and fits 6 participants. Tours include bike
rental, but customers can upgrade bike types for an additional fee-upgrading from
included city bike to electric costs €10 for the tour duration.

Bikes need regular maintenance based on kilometers ridden. City bikes need servicing
every 500km, electric bikes every 300km due to motor checks, mountain bikes every
400km. Track odometer readings at each return. When a bike approaches its service
threshold, flag it and remove from available inventory until serviced. Track maintenance
costs per bike to calculate true profitability.

Customers often want to extend rentals. Someone rents for 4 hours, then calls asking
for 4 more. Check availability-if the bike was reserved by someone else starting in 2
hours, deny the extension. Damage deposits of €50 for regular bikes and €150 for
electric bikes are held until return. Track damage history per bike and per customer-
repeat offenders pay higher deposits.
